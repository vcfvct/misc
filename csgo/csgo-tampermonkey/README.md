## overview
a tampermonkey script to refresh the csgo market site periodically if no new item added. otherwise, send browser desktop reminder as well as adding a top banner as new item reminder. 

The `C5game` script can only be used outside U.S. A U.S ip will be redirect to some fake site by c5game to avoid issues from steam I guess. 

NOTE: it should be run in ES6.
